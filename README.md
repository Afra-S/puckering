# Puckering

###calculating the the frequency of presence of a certain pucker family for each nucleotide, as well as the average and fluctuation of pucker phase and pucker amplitude, using molecular dynamics simulations

$a=0.4 \sum_{i=1}^5 \nu_i \cos[0.8\pi (i-1)]$ and $b=-0.4 \sum_{i=1}^5 \nu_i \sin[0.8\pi (i-1)]$

Seperate the trajectory
